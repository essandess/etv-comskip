This directory should contain support files for running the windows version of comskip directly on intel macs.

There are two needed components, wine and comskip itself.   Download the appropriate packages and place Wine.app in this directory
and unzip the comskip distribution into a directory here named something like comskip80_031.

The version of wine is from:

     http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/

The version of comskip is from:

    http://www.kaashoek.com/files/

MakeCommercials.py now points to this version.
