1.0RC1:  Initial Release

1.0RC2:  Moved from applescript FileWatcher to C++ FileWatcher


1.0RC3: Fixed bug in MarkCommercials.sh where file name had a single quote
        in it (it's interesting how many TV shows do this!)

        Implemented "all" flag for FileWatcher to scan all files.

        Fixed bugs in ComSkipper.app script which would cause it to stop
        running if a file with no corresponding commercials .plist was played.

        
1.0RC4: Fixed bug starting FileWatcher

1.0RC5: Replace ComSkipper.app application with ComSkipper.app application
        bundle (wrong save-as type was selected in ScriptEditor, resulting
        in a PPC/Classic application!)

        Migrated to Google Code
