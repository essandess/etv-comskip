1.0RC1:  Initial Release

1.0RC2:  Moved from applescript FileWatcher to C++ FileWatcher


1.0RC3: Fixed bug in MarkCommercials.sh where file name had a single quote
        in it (it's interesting how many TV shows do this!)

        Implemented "all" flag for FileWatcher to scan all files.

        Fixed bugs in ComSkipper.app script which would cause it to stop
        running if a file with no corresponding commercials .plist was played.

        
1.0RC4: Fixed bug starting FileWatcher

1.0RC5: Replace ComSkipper.app application with ComSkipper.app application
        bundle (wrong save-as type was selected in ScriptEditor, resulting
        in a PPC/Classic application!)

        Migrated to Google Code

1.0RC8: Initial EyeTV3 version.

        Added installers, installed in to /Library/Application Support/ETVComskip
        Converted from raw python to mac app bundles
        added logging to ~/Library/Logs/ETVComskip

        No longer uses FileWatcher, but uses RecordingDone triggered script
        replaced ComSkipper.app applescript with new python-based mac bundle
        MarkCommercials.sh replaced by python script / app bundle
        MarkCommercials.app now optionally reads config file to skip processing of certain channels, titles, etc.
