Development environment:

  To work on ETVComskip (particularly the python scripts), you'll need
  py-appscript which enables python to speak to AppleScript.  If you
  haven't already done so, install py-appscript from:
  appscript.sourceforge.net.  Get the tar.gz form from sourceforge and
  follow the instructions in the readme.  Current version of
  py-appscript is 0.18.1.  We do NOT support 0.19.x.

  To build a the python applications, you'll need py2app.  I got my copy from 
  http://undefined.org/python/py2app.html.

  And, of course, you'll need Xcode installed to build comskip itself

Building a distribution:

  From the main directory, type "make".  This will create an ETVComskip subdirectory,
  and fill it with the executables created via py2app and gcc.


NOTE: bundling the applications with py2app was chosen over shipping
pure python to ease installation for the end-user.  This way, all the
components needed for running the python are bundled into the
distribution and no other software needs to be installed.
