       Indeed, we should align it:
         on 4 for 386
         on 16 for 486
	 on 32 for 586, PPro - k6-III
	 on 64 for K7 (maybe for P3 too).
       Because L1 and L2 caches are aligned on those values.
       But I don't want to code such logic here!
     */
     /* Why 16?
        because some cpus need alignment, for example SSE2 on P4, & most RISC cpus
        it will just trigger an exception and the unaligned load will be done in the
        exception handler or it will just segfault (SSE2 on P4)
        Why not larger? because i didnt see a difference in benchmarks ...
