ETVComskip, EyeTV3 version

Commercial detection and skipping for EyeTV3, using a Mac OS X port of 
comskip (http://www.kaashoek.com/comskip/).

These programs allow users of EyeTV to enjoy commercial-free recorded television

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION:

  1) Copy RecordingDone.scpt to /Library/Application\ Support/EyeTV/Scripts/TriggeredScripts

  2) Copy comskip, comskip.ini and MarkCommercials.py to /Library/Application\ Support/ETVComskip

  3) If you haven't already done so, install py-appscript from:
      appscript.sourceforge.net.  Get the tar.gz form from sourceforge
      and follow the instructions in the readme.  I don't know what to do with an .egg file!

  4) Restart EyeTV.


  (Yes, I hope to have an installer package soon.)


RUNNING:

   Once installed, after a new recording is made, EyeTV will call
   RecordingDone.scpt, which simply calls MarkCommercials.py.  This runs
   comskip, and parses its output, and tells EyeTV where the commercial
   markers should be.

   When you play back a recording in EyeTV with markers in it, when
   playback is between a start and end marker (i.e. within a commercial
   break), pressing the forward key on the remote will jump to the end of
   the break.

   Note that there is currently no ComSkipper.app for the EyeTV3 version
   script to automatically skip breaks.


BATCH MODE:

   If you have a library of recordings you'd like to mark you can run
   MarkCommercials.py in batch mode.

   From the terminal run:

     bash$ MarkCommercials.py all

There are many options for tuning comskip, but they are beyond the scope
of this document.  For details, see http://www.kaashoek.com/comskip/, and
