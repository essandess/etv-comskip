ETVComskip, EyeTV3 version

Commercial detection and skipping for EyeTV3, using a Mac OS X port of 
comskip (http://www.kaashoek.com/comskip/).

These programs allow users of EyeTV to enjoy commercial-free recorded television

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION:

  1) Copy RecordingDone.scpt to /Library/Application\ Support/EyeTV/Scripts/TriggeredScripts

  2) Copy comskip, comskip.ini, MarkCommercials.py and MarkCommercials.cfg to /Library/Application\ Support/ETVComskip

  3) If you haven't already done so, install py-appscript from:
      appscript.sourceforge.net.  Get the tar.gz form from sourceforge
      and follow the instructions in the readme.  Current version of py-appscript 
      is 0.18.1.  We do NOT support 0.19.x.

  4) Restart EyeTV.


  (Yes, We hope to have an installer package soon.)


RUNNING:

   Once installed, after a new recording is made, EyeTV will call
   RecordingDone.scpt, which simply calls MarkCommercials.py.  This runs
   comskip, and parses its output, and tells EyeTV where the commercial
   markers should be.

   When you play back a recording in EyeTV with markers in it, when
   playback is between a start and end marker (i.e. within a commercial
   break), pressing the forward key on the remote will jump to the end of
   the break.

   Note that there is currently no ComSkipper.app for the EyeTV3 version
   script to automatically skip breaks.

MarkCommercials:

   1.  is version 0.3.0.
   2.  allows user supplied options
   3.  Run it in command line mode to get help
      bash$ ./MarkCommercials.py --help
   4.  Output of 0.3.0 help:

Macintosh:My Comskip rick$ ./MarkCommercials.py --help
Usage: MarkCommercials.py [options] [RECORDING-ID | 'all' | 'forceall']

Options:
  --version          show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --noexclude        Do NOT exclude recordings specified in cfg file,
                     default=False
  --force            Force commercial marking on specified RECORDING-ID.
                     Allows marking when markers already exist, default=False
  --growl            Enable growl notification, default=False
  --log              Enable logging, default=False
  --app=APP          Specify EyeTV application name, default=EyeTV
  --verbose=VERBOSE  Verbosity level, 0-10, default=0

  5.  Recordings can be excluded by using the MarkCommercials.cfg file.
      Instructions are at the beginning of the cfg file.
      There are some problems with this in that not every recording contains
      the correct information.  See cfg file for our experience.
  6.  You can avoid any cfg file induced excluding with the --noeclude option 
  7.  will not create new markers when markers already exist on the recording.
  8.  You can override the behavior of item #7 with the --force option.
  9.  Logging (information about the behavior of MarkCommercials and commskip written
      a file(s)) is enabled via the --log option.  Use the console utility to view
      / delete these files.  The files are located under your home directory.
      ~/Library/Logs/ETVComskip/
  10. The --app=APP option allows you to specify the name of the EyeTV application.
      An example of usage is when you get a beta version which has the version number
      as part of it's name.  (EyeTV-3.0.1b5)  The -app option would be --appEyeTV-3.0.b5)
  11. The --verbose option tells MarkCommercials and comskip to be more verbose in
      the data put to the log.  

BATCH MODE:

   If you have a library of recordings you'd like to mark you can run
   MarkCommercials.py in batch mode.

   From the terminal run:

     bash$ MarkCommercials.py all

There are many options for tuning comskip, but they are beyond the scope
of this document.  For details, see http://www.kaashoek.com/comskip/, and
